4. Read over the results, and write a paragraph that explains the pattern you see. How does each function “scale”? Which of the two functions scales better? How can you tell?

When applying the push() and unshift() methods on arrays of various sizes, the results show a consistent pattern. In each example, the time used to run code using push() is significantly less than that with unshift(). This shows that push() scales more efficiently than unshift(). As the array size goes from Tiny to Extra Large, the execution time of both push() and unshift() increases, however the unshift() method constantly takes substantially longer than push().
